Recently I decided that it would be a good idea for the company I work
for to start looking in to `Apache Solr`_ for use with some of our
bigger clients, I will report any fun I find it with back here including
installation on Debian/Ubuntu and most likely complain about Jetty and
Tomcat because I hate both and am really not looking forward to working
with them again, even though I am excited about Solr itself.
