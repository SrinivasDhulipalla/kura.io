.. _`https://syslog.tv/`: https://syslog.tv/

I finally stopped being lazy and decided to create an HTTPS version of
this blog. I know it's not at all required but I decided it could/would
be a good thing to do anyway.

For now due to the blog software being crappy it's showing an invalid
certificate due to including resources that are not secured - I'll work
on fixing that.
