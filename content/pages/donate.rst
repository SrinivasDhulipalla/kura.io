Donations for the work I do are not required but are nice to receive. Most of
the donations I receive are for the `Tor relays that I provide
<https://kura.io/tor/>`__.

If you wish to donate based on my work with Tor, you can also donate using
`oniontip.com <https://oniontip.com/>`__, distributing your donation between
relay operators.
