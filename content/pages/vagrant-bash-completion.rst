vagrant-bash-completion is as it sounds - bash completion
script for `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`_.

They were originally written by `Nikita Fedyashev
<https://github.com/nfedyashev/>`_, I just modified his
work and made some changes. Eventually he ended up deleting
his version and forking mine.

Originally the completion scripts were meant to be used by
myself and developers from my company, but they started to
gain traction and now are quite widely used.

OS X support was added by `Conor McDermottroe
<https://github.com/conormcd>`_ and `Nils Caspar
<https://github.com/pencil>`_ added it to Homebrew.
