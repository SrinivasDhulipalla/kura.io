I am capable of working in several roles; Systems Engineer,
Administrator, Technical Architect and Developer. I can write Python,
PHP, Java, C and Perl although generally I mostly write asynchronous
Python and mostly using PyPy and when I'm not writing Python I'll be
writing C.

I am a developer and maintainer for the Debian operating system and also
the Ubuntu operating system. I have also designed and built my own
Debian-based distribution designed for fast provisioning and scale for
web-based applications.

I have a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence and also in Physics.
