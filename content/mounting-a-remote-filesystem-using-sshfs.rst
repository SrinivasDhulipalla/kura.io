First we need to install sshfs.

    sudo apt-get install sshfs fuse-utils

Now we make a mount point, I'm going to use a directory in my home
directory for this.

    mkdï»¿ir ~/remote-content

And now we simply mount our remote directory to it.

    sshfs user@host:/path/to/location ~/remote-content

It's as simple as that.
